stated proposed rule 17ad22e7 prudent appropriate light need covered clearing agency maintain adequate liquidity minimize systemic risk requiring ongoing testing monitoring underlying assumption covered clearing agency able identify potential problem sufficient time respond without significant disruption. four commenters expressed support commission ’ proposed approach qualifying liquid resource committed funding arrangement discussed partc7b. due diligence liquidity provider two commenters stated requirement proposed rule 17ad22e7iv regarding policy procedure perform due diligence liquidity provider must take account context due diligence performed. one commenters stated commercial lender likely provide borrower nonpublic information internal policy control accordingly covered clearing agency expected evaluate commercial lender ’ internal risk control. first experience commission staff liquidity facility may consist traditional commercial loan. example covered clearing agency may seek committed repurchase agreement facility counterparties traditional commercial lender. circumstance commenter ’ experience counterparties may different traditional commercial lender. accordingly contrast commenter ’ assertion covered clearing agency may engage relationship liquidity provider typical commercial lender therefore may willing facilitate due diligence. second commission acknowledges lender may choose provide borrower non public information certain internal policy control proposed rule require covered clearing agency ’ policy procedure regarding due diligence liquidity provider specifically review internal policy control. rather requires due diligence policy procedure confirm covered clearing agency reasonable basis believe liquidity provider understands manages liquidity provider ’ liquidity risk capacity perform required commitment provide liquidity covered clearing agency. performing due diligence consistent policy procedure formulated accordance rule covered clearing agency confirm reasonable basis believe required criterion covered clearing agency would liquidity provider consistent rule 17ad22e7iv. second commenter stated appropriate require covered clearing agency perform due diligence central bank acting liquidity provider request rule clarify requirement rule 17ad22e7iv apply central bank liquidity provider covered clearing agency. commission believe rule need modified account circumstance however policy procedure covered clearing agency could account different circumstance third commenter expressed view commission clarify due diligence requirement proposed rule 17ad22e7iv expressly require covered clearing agency take account potential wrongway risk associated reliance participant affiliate liquidity provider. commenter stated commission take additional step mitigate wrongway risk requiring covered clearing agency ensure appropriate diversification liquidity provider limit reliance participant affiliate potential source liquidity. commission belief diversifying liquidity provider may helpful diversification would result le concentrated potentially manageable financial commitment among covered clearing agency ’ liquidity provider. example covered clearing agency generally conduct assessment liquidity provider ’ business light covered clearing agency ’ business composition existing

partc7b. qualifying liquid resource commenters generally supported commission ’ proposed approach determining qualifying liquid resource. one commenter supported commission ’ overall approach particular inclusion asset readily available convertible cash repurchase agreement. another commenter supported commission ’ approach definition “ qualifying liquid resource ” expressed view expansion qualifying liquid resource beyond committed funding arrangement necessary ensure proper functioning covered clearing agency. commenter noted committed liquidity facility would generally preferable noncommitted facility commenter also acknowledged aspect facility eg size cost facility may tip balance toward selection noncommitted facility. particular commenter emphasized unique liquidity need clearing entity limited number capacity liquidity provider market willing able participate committed liquidity facility clearing entity commercial regulatory reality could constrain availability committed facility covered clearing agency. commission mindful concern note policy procedure providing use uncommitted facility must also satisfy term rule 17ad22e15 address general business operational risk could arise uncommitted facility. one commenter stated requiring covered clearing agency rely committed funding arrangement case could increase covered clearing agency ’ reliance participant affiliated bank potentially exacerbate liquidity crisis transferring risk covered clearing agency liquidity provider vice versa. however comment assumes rule prohibits reliance type facility prearranged funding arrangement case. degree purpose liquidity facility transfer risk covered clearing agency liquidity provider. resource described definition “ qualifying liquid resource ”

may used clearing member default scenario extreme market circumstance. commenter also stated covered clearing agency ’ procedure making draw uncommitted repurchase facility specifically contemplate
